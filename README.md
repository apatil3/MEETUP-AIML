# MEETUP-AIML


In this example, I have taken a hypothetical scenario of code rating based on the number and type of issues. I have build the model using this sample dataset to predict the code rating based on issue count and type.

We will use Jupyter Notebook to
1. Import the data
2. Clean the data
3. Split the data into Training/Test Sets
4. Create a Model
5. Train the Model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate & Calculate the accuracy
8. Persisting Models
9. Exposing the Persisted Model into a Flask API
10.UI driven execution of API
