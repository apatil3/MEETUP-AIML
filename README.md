# MEETUP-AIML


In this example, I have taken a hypothetical scenario of code rating on the basis of number and type of issues. I have build a model using this sample data to predict the code rating on the basis of issue count and type.

We will use Jupyter Notebook to
1. Import the data
2. Clean the data
3. Split the data into Training/Test Sets
4. Create a Model
5. Train the Model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evalute & Calculate the accuracy
8. Persisting Models
9. Exposing the Persisted Model into a Flask API
10.UI driven execution of API
